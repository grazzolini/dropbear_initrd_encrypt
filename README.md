# dropbear_initrd_encrypt
Archlinux mkinitcpio hooks for installing dropbear inside the initramfs and allow remote unlocking of luks root over the network

### THIS HOOK WAS SPLIT!
This hook shouldn't be used anymore. It was split into 3 separate packages:

* https://github.com/grazzolini/mkinitcpio-netconf
* https://github.com/grazzolini/mkinitcpio-dropbear
* https://github.com/grazzolini/mkinitcpio-utils

Please utilise those hooks instead! Further development and improvement of this hook will happen in those packages.
